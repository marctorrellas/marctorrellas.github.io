In my free time, I like to workÂ on mini-projects, usually to solve little problems or to automate or ease tasks I used to do. While sometimes they are simplerÂ than others, I see them as an opportunity forÂ learning something. This is usually more important than the final objective, since most tasks manually would have been more time-efficient ðŸ™‚
