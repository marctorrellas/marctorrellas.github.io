If you're looking for plugin to set up a multilingual site with manual translated pages, try to use Polylang plugin instead.

WordPress does not support multilingual blog out-of-the-box. There are several free plugins which allow to do that: WPGlobus, Polylang, qTranslate or xili-language plugins are installable on standalone WordPress sites. For multisite WordPress (one website per language), you can try Multisite Language Switcher, Zanto or Multilingual Press or commercial WPML.
