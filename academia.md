I developed a PhD in Wireless Communications during four years (2011-2015). Prior to that, while finishing my M.Sc (2006-2011), I became an intern (2009-2011) at the Signal Theory and Communications (TSC) [group](https://spcom.upc.edu/) of the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), in Barcelona.

All papers produced during my PhD, as well as my thesis, can be easily found, see [here](https://spcom.upc.edu/index.php?user=marc), also available in my [CV](https://marctorrellas.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/CV_MarcTorrellas.pdf), and in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.es/citations?user=__4XCdYAAAAJ&hl=en). Some of them can also be obtained from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).
